# Caterpillargame
This code implements a simple caterpillar game using the turtle graphics module. The player controls a caterpillar that moves around the screen, attempting to eat leaves to grow longer. The game increases in speed as the caterpillar eats more leaves and scores points. If the caterpillar moves outside the window boundary, the game ends.
